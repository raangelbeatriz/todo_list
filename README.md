# To-Do List
 
## ‚ú® About
To-Do List is an app where the user can create, manage and delete tasks. This project was made using a modular architecture, Provider as a state manager, and Firebase Auth. My goal was to learn more about modular architecture and topics such as Dependency Injection and the use of Service Layers.
